Global Air Quality Analysis: Predicting AQI
 Project Summary
This project analyzed a Global Air Pollution Dataset to build highly accurate machine learning models for predicting Air Quality Index (AQI). The core objective was to predict the AQI Value (Regression) and classify the AQI Category (Classification) based on readings of individual pollutants (CO, Ozone, NO2, PM2.5).
